# Auto-Zooming Cameraman for Basketball Games

This repository contains the code and tools for developing an AI-powered auto-zooming cameraman system. The system dynamically adjusts the camera's zoom and focus based on the movements of players and actions.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv11 Object detection and tracks players, and the basketball in real-time.
- **Auto-Zooming**: Automatically adjusts the zoom to ensure relevant actions are always in focus.
- **Post-Processing**: Smoothens transitions for a seamless viewing experience.
- **Interactive Tools**: Enables manual adjustments and visualization for better control.
